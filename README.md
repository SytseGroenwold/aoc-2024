My repository for Advent of Code 2024. 

Due to time constraints and an interest in aider chat's new architect mode; this year I will attempt to solve all problems without writing a single line of code.
My start is using aider chat with 4o/o1 as architect and claude as editor.
I will include my prompts at the beggining of each problem, as that is technically my solution, the code is just the implementation not by me.
